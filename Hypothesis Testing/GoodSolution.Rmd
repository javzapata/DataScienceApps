Consider the same data collected with the poor solution, but using an hypothesis test instead. Denote by $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$  the true height of trees with and without fertilizer respectively.

The hypothesis test consist of two main steps:

__1. Test Design__: The *null hypothesis* $H_0$ is a relation between these two values ($\mu_1 \leq \mu_2$, $\mu_1 = \mu_2$ or  $\mu_1 > \mu_2$) that you assume is true. You compare this hypothesis against a deviation from it (the *alternative hypothesis* $H_A$) under a significance level $\alpha$ between $0$ and $1$. 

__2. Using the Test__: You compute a $\text{p-value}$ of a *test statistic* obtained from the observed data. If $\text{p-value}<\alpha$ you reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, you fail to reject it.
For more details on how to compute the *test statistic*, please check the Reference box below.


With this approach you will have an error guarantee given by the chosen significance level $\alpha$.
