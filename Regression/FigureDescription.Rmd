We have fitted a leaste squares regression line to a sample of 30 points from the data. The *Sum of Squares* in the figures sums the area of all the resulting squares. As you change the value of the slope, see how the sum of squares changes in the figure on the right.

Do you see any pattern? How does it compare to the least squares?
