The least squares regression finds estimates $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ to fit a line through the data points so that the differences between the observed values and corresponding points on the fitted line to be "small" in some overall sense. In particular, least squares minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations.

The least squares method give us unbiased estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. Hence, we can interpret $\hat{\beta}_1$ as the expected change in the pine's diameter with respect to a one-unit increase in the pine's height.
