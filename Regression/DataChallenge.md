Some researchers believe that the diameter of a pine tree depends linearly on its height as:

$$\text{Diameter} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Height}$$
The coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are known the **intercept** and **slope**, respectively. 

Using a sample of 30 pines measured at 1997, how can you estimate the values of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ ? Can you give an interpretation?
