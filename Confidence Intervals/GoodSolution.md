By the Central Limit Theorem the sample average is approximately normal. Hence, we can compute a $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for the mean as: $\bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \hat{\sigma}$. 

For example, if $\alpha=0.05$ then this interval contains the true height of the pine with probability $1-\alpha=95\%$.
